/* graph.hpp — graph analysis a C++ host can afford at 10^5–10^6 runes.
 *
 * Void Core's graph analytics (its okf/concepts/graph-analytics.md) are a Python
 * holiday by design — "heavy algorithms never enter the core" — which no C++
 * host can call, and whose betweenness is Brandes, O(V·E): hours at Void
 * Hormiga's stress scale (5×10^5 runes, ~10^6 links). This is the host-side
 * half that SPEC places in hosts, written for that scale and for this family's
 * one non-negotiable property: the same graph gives the same answer, every run,
 * on every machine (fixed node order, a fixed-seed generator of our own, no
 * iteration over unordered containers), so a clustering can be replayed.
 *
 *  - a compact CSR graph (offsets + neighbours + weights): ~12 bytes per edge end;
 *  - connected components (union–find, O(E α(V)));
 *  - PageRank (power iteration, O(k·E));
 *  - COMMUNITIES by the Leiden algorithm (Traag, Waltman & van Eck, Scientific
 *    Reports 9:5233, 2019), optimising modularity with a resolution γ:
 *        Q = 1/(2m) Σ_ij [A_ij − γ k_i k_j / (2m)] δ(c_i, c_j).
 *    Leiden is Louvain (Blondel et al. 2008) plus a REFINEMENT phase that only
 *    merges well-connected subsets, which is what guarantees every community is
 *    connected — Louvain can return communities that fall apart internally,
 *    and a cluster a person browses as "one group" must not;
 *  - a HIERARCHY: Leiden again inside every community larger than a target
 *    size, recursively, until each is small. "Smaller and smaller clusters" is
 *    exactly this tree; a view can show level 1 and expand one community at a
 *    time, so what it draws is bounded by a cluster's size, not the mantle's
 *    (hierarchical aggregation, Elmqvist & Fekete, IEEE TVCG 2010).
 *  - NMI, to measure a clustering against known groups. */
